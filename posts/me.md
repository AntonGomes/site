**Hey! I'm Anton. A 19 year old Scottish/Portuguese student at Edinburgh University and aspiring software engineer. üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøüáµüáπ**

I was introduced to programming through a school project a few years ago. Now, after becoming increasing enthralled by the possibilities and power of coding, I've let an _obsession_ with the field come over me. 

This passion for programming not only led me to study Computing Science at the University of Edinburgh, but has now given me the drive to pursue a career as a software engineer. 

In my spare time I use my creativity, attentiveness to detail, and focus to imagine and build original projects. I thrive on the sense of achivement these projects permit. 

The rapid progress coding allows for always amazes me. From something as significant as picking up a new language or finishing a build; to the everyday triumphs such as learning a new command or fixing that bug that's been bothering me. 

I am resourceful and able to develop my coding skills independently. Being conscious of my learning practice, and equipped with learning resources, I am able to tackle coding challenges I am faced with.
