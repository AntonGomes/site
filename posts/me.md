#### Hey! I'm Anton. A 19 year-old Scottish-Portuguese aspiring software engineer. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇵🇹👨‍💻

I began programming two years ago. After getting carried away with a school project, I let an obsession with the field come over me.

This passion for programming not only influenced me to study Computing Science at the University of Edinburgh, but has now given me the drive to pusue a career as a software engineer.

I enjoy using my creativity to imagine and build original projects, in which, I let my attentiveness to detail, work ethic, and focus, assits me in reaching my objective. Said projects allow me to occupy all my spare time with practicing and improving my skills.

I love the sense of achivement from attaining a goal. Whether it be picking up a new language, finishing a build, or once again coming to the realisation that there is **always** more to learn.

Through coding, I have obtained the invaluable skill of self-teaching. I pride myself in my belief that my understanding of my learning style, and a knowledge of learning resources, allow me to solve almost any problem I am faced with.
